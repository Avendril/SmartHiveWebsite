# SmartHiveWebsite-

Complete website, all features are working as intended, only the angle Display is not working currently as it was only a last minute addition, When I get back to working on the website I will get it working correctly.

Features:

-Website is compatible with a mqtt broker and able to process as well as display the data taken.

-Display data with timestamp without any delays.

-Display data as graphs, 3d models or text!

-Helpful notes to help you understand everything as well as comments!
